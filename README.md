Python Challenges: Two different datasets are analysed as part of this challenge.
  1.PyBank
  2.PyPoll

PyBank: 
-------
  Financial dataset with columns `Date` and `Profit/Losses` is analysed. 
  With the Python script, the items calculated are total number of months in the dataset, net total amount of profit/losses, average change in profit/losses over entire period, greatest increase in profit, greatest decrease in loss.
  The summary of the financial analysis is then written to both terminal and file named `Results_from_Analysis.txt` successfully.
  
PyPoll:
-------
  The dataset of poll data with columns `Voter ID`,`County`,`Candidate` is analysed.
  With the Python script, total number of votes cast is counted, list of candidates who received votes is found, total number of votes and percentage of vote each candidate received is calculated. With the help of percentage of votes, the winner of the election is determined.
  The summary of the election data analysis is then written to both terminal and file named `Results_from_Analysis.txt` successfully.
