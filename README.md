Python Challenges: Two different datasets are analysed as part of this challenge.
  1.PyBank
  2.PyPoll

PyBank: 
-------
  The input dataset is a bank's monthly profits/losses over period. The dataset has two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.
  
  Following are computed from the input dataset:
  
    1.Total number of months for which Profits/losses are provided.
    
    2.Net total amount of profit/losses.
    
    3.Average change in profit/losses over entire period.
    
    4.The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.  
    
    5.The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
  
   The summary of the financial analysis is print on the terminal and exported to the file named `Results_from_Analysis.txt`.


PyPoll:
-------
  The input dataset is the poll data from a rural town. The dataset has columns such as `Voter ID`,`County`,`Candidate` to analyse.
  
  Following are computed from the input dataset:
    
    1.Total number of votes cast is counted.
    
    2.List of candidates who received votes and their corresponding total votes are calculated.
     
    3.Percentage of vote each candidate received.
    
    4.The winner of the election is determined.
  
  The summary of the election data analysis is print on the terminal and exported to the file named `Results_from_Analysis.txt`.
